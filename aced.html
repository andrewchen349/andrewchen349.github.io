            <div class="bigidea">During the development time of Aced, I developed the app's calendar, checklist, and notes feature. I created an SQLite database to store users' information for easy offline access.</div>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>Aced is a student planner app for the Android platform that allow students to add events to calendar, create task checklist and take offline notes and ideas anywhere.</p>
            <p>Aced was created as a personal project with the goal of making students' academic lives easier. Aced is an all in one app combining the essentials tools for student to effectivley manage and plan their academic schedule to maximize success.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="projectsection">
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>At the start of development of Aced, I had little knowledge about Android Studio, Android development and UI design. With the intention of releasing the app by August in time for the start of the school semester, I self taught myself android development as well as SQLite, to save user data offline, in about 2 weeks.</p>
            <p>As the lead developer with the most experience on the team, I explain many Android development concepts I learn to my team members and made sure features and design was being created and developed on time.</p>
            <p> The knowledge I gain from the development of this app is priceless. I hope to further improve on the skills I acquired from this personal project and to use these skills to make an impact, whether its freelance work or at a company to really make a difference.

            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p>Aced is still in the works! New features are still being currently developed :). Aced will have location features using Google routes, map, and places API giving user directions to their next class, as well as reminding students of a task they have once they are near a certain target location. Stay tuned!!
